  title={Polymeric nanocomposites in a biological interface: From a molecular view to final applications},
  author={Schmidt, RCR and Oliveira, TE and Deon M.},
  abstract={Polymeric nanocomposites have been valuable materials for the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields because they associate the unique properties of a material on a nanoscale with a polymeric matrix, with a synergistic outcome that improves their physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Understanding the nature of the physical and chemical interactions and effects that take place at the polymer-nanomaterial interface is crucial to predict and explain how the nanocomposite behaves when set forth a health-related application and faces a biological interface. Therefore, this review aimed to assemble and examine experimental articles in which the molecular-level interaction between nanomaterials and polymer matrices were determinants of the biological outcome. For health applications, the nanocomposite systems were found to be most applied as antimicrobials, for tissue engineering, and for drug delivery. A plethora of biocompatible polymers have been reported, although for nanomaterials the most distinguished effects were attained with metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. The bioactivity of the nanocomposite was found to be dependent on features such as: colloidal size, release, and disintegration of the nanoparticle, controlled by the polymer matrix; hydrophilicity, degree of crosslinking, porosity, mechanical strength, and stability/responsiveness of the polymer, modified by the nanofiller; and the final charge and functional groups available at the whole nanocomposite surface. As a result, researchers can gather insights to design and characterize advanced polymeric nanocomposites with optimized performance for use in biomedical devices, drug delivery systems, and other therapeutic applications.},

  title={Naproxen-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles: How can the process of incorporation affect drug placement, drug release and the in vitro naproxen irritant potential?},
  author={Funk, NL and Tavaniello, FC and Dos Santos, J and Benvenutti, EV and Buchner, S and Paese, K and Deon, M and Beck, RCR},
  abstract={Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) serve as versatile drug nanocarriers to avoid the interaction of highly irritant drugs with stomach mucosa, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In this study, spherical and nanometric particles (181 ± 11 nm) with long-channel nanopores (∼2.5 nm in diameter) hexagonally arranged were synthesised. The NSAID naproxen (NPX) was incorporated into MSN by using the incipient wetness method. NPX ethanolic solutions of 30 mg mL−1 (NPX-ES-30) and 40 mg mL−1 (NPX-ES-40) were employed to obtain MSN-NPX30-1 and MSN-NPX40-1, corresponding to 8.26 % and 10.12 % (w/w) NPX loading, respectively. A second incorporation was performed to produced MSN-NPX30-2 and MSN-NPX40-2, with 13.45 % and 16.78 % (w/w) NPX loading, respectively. A reduction in surface area and pore volume was observed for all drug-loaded formulations compared to bare MSN. Notably, formulations prepared with NPX-ES-40 exhibited a less pronounced reduction, indicating that a portion of the drug was likely positioned outside the MSN pores. In contrast, NPX-ES-30 formulations showed efficient internalization of NPX into the mesopores, resulting in a more significant reduction in surface area and pore volume following drug incorporation. The enhanced silica–drug interaction in these formulations resulted in a slower NPX release rate compared with the NPX-ES-40 formulations, and a lower in vitro irritation score for the hen's eggs test on chorioallantoic membrane. In conclusion, the concentration of the NPX solution influenced the drug placement within MSN pores and, therefore, the NPX drug release rate and in vitro irritant potential.},
